This repository contains useful tools and data related to my work on forest products.

Content is listed in a menu generated from [_site.yml](_site.yml).

The site is built with [rmarkdown websites](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html), using the R command:

    rmarkdown::render_site()
    
Use `CTRL+SHIFT+B` to build the site in RStudio.

This shell command can also be used:

    cd ~/rp/paulrougieux.github.io && Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render_site()"

Or simply use the `makefile`

    make
