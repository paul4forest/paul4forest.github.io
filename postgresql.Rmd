This document explains the installation and configuration of the PostgreSQL database engine.

# Install PostgreSQL

Install PostgreSQL

    sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client

Debian wiki explains [how to install and set up
PostgreSQL](https://wiki.debian.org/PostgreSql).


# Create a user and a database

Add system users at the regular bash shell before you can add them in
postgresql. I call this user "rdb" because I plan to use R to connect to the
database and "R" cannot be used as a user name according to system policy.

    sudo adduser rdb --disabled-password 

Login as the default user postgres
Now logged in as `postgres@machine_name` in the regular bash shell 

    sudo -u postgres bash

    # or 
    sudo su postgres

1. Create a user with the same name as the system user created above

    createuser --pwprompt rdb

    # Create a user for myself
    createuser paul 

2. Create a database owned by that user

    createdb -O rdb tradeflows

    createdb -O paul tradeflows_migrated

# Connect to a database

## Configuration file .pgpass

This is the prefered way to connect to the database for scripts. Create a
`~/.pgpass` file to store the connection details for that user:

    echo 'localhost:5432:tradeflows:rdb:localhost' >> ~/.pgpass

Secure the file:

    chmod 600 ~/.pgpass

Connect to the database:

    psql -d tradeflows -h localhost -U rdb

## As a system user

Login as the user who is the owner of that database

    sudo su rdb

Connect to the database

    psql tradeflows

# Data types


## Character

[Datatype
character](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/datatype-character.html):

| Name                             | Description                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| character varying(n), varchar(n) | variable-length with limit |
| character(n), char(n)            | fixed-length, blank padded |
| text                             | variable unlimited length  |

Tip: 

> "There is no performance difference among these three types, apart from
> increased storage space when using the blank-padded type, and a few extra CPU
> cycles to check the length when storing into a length-constrained column.
> While character(n) has performance advantages in some other database systems,
> there is no such advantage in PostgreSQL; in fact character(n) is usually the
> slowest of the three because of its additional storage costs. In most
> situations text or character varying should be used instead." 


# Drop

Delete a database

    postgres=# drop database databasename;

Delete a schema

    psql -d tradeflows -h localhost -U rdb -c "DROP SCHEMA raw_comext"
    ERROR:  cannot drop schema raw_comext because other objects depend on it
    DETAIL:  table raw_comext.monthly depends on schema raw_comext
    HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.

Here is the command with a drop in cascade

    psql -d tradeflows -h localhost -U rdb -c "DROP SCHEMA raw_comext CASCADE"


# Dump

Examples copied from `man pg_dump`. To dump a database called mydb into a SQL-script file:

    $ pg_dump mydb > db.sql

To reload such a script into a (freshly created) database named newdb:

    $ psql -d newdb -f db.sql


## Remove statements

The dump contained the following two statements which I removed:

    SET default_tablespace = '';

    SET default_with_oids = false;

I removed default table space because the official documentation for [table
spaces](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/manage-ag-tablespaces.html)
says it doesn't make sense to have more than one table space per system.

I removed default_with_oids because [this
posrt](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/101281/what-is-the-relevance-of-set-default-with-oids-true-in-a-postgresql-dump)
explains that it's used to enable a legacy feature.

## Migrate from MySQL into PostgreSQL

* ipostgresql.org [converting from other databases to
  postgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Converting_from_other_Databases_to_PostgreSQL#MySQL)
* [pgloader](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader)

Transfer data from MySQL to PostgreSQL:

    pgloader mysql://user@localhost/sakila postgresql:///pagila

For my own database I used:

    sudo su postgres
    createdb -O paul tradeflows_migrated
    exit # Go back to user "paul"
    pgloader mysql://paul@localhost/tradeflows postgresql:///tradeflows_migrated

# Road map

postgresql.org [Roadmap](https://www.postgresql.org/developer/roadmap/)



# Schema

Official documentation postgresql.org
[schemas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html)

> "A database contains one or more named schemas, which in turn contain tables.
> Schemas also contain other kinds of named objects, including data types,
> functions, and operators. The same object name can be used in different
> schemas without conflict; for example, both schema1 and myschema can contain
> tables named mytable. Unlike databases, schemas are not rigidly separated: a
> user can access objects in any of the schemas in the database they are
> connected to, if they have privileges to do so." 

> "There are several reasons why one might want to use schemas:"

* "To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each
  other."
* "To organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable."
* "Third-party applications can be put into separate schemas so they do not collide
  with the names of other objects." 

> "Schemas are analogous to directories at the operating system level, except
> that schemas cannot be nested."
