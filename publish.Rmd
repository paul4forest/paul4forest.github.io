> **Describing similarities**: likewise, correspondingly, equally, not only…
> but also, in the same way, similarly

> **Showing cause and effect**: consequently, as a result, thus, hence (never
> ‘hence why’), since (try to avoid ‘as’ when showing cause and effect),
> because, therefore, accordingly, this suggests that, it follows that, for
> this reason 

> **Comparing and contrasting**: alternatively, however, conversely, on the
> other hand, instead, yet, on the contrary

> whilst!), even so, on the contrary, nevertheless, nonetheless, although,
> admittedly 

> **Emphasis, addition or examples**: to illustrate, to clarify, further (not
> ‘furthermore’), first, second and third (not firstly, secondly and thirdly),

> "Coordinating conjunctions connect words or phrases that serve the same grammatical purpose in a sentence. There are seven main coordinating conjunctions in English, which form the acronym FANBOYS:

> F: for: The teachers were frustrated, for the school had cut funding for all 
>    enrichment programs.

> A: and: In this course, I will write a literature review, a case study, and a final 
>    paper.

> N: nor: The students did not complete their homework, nor did they pass the test.

> B: but: The study is several years old but still valuable to this study.

> O: or: At the end of the class, the students can choose to write an essay or take a test.

> Y: yet: The patient complained of chronic pain, yet she refused treatment.

> S: so: I have only been a nurse for one year, so I have little experience with paper 
     charting.*


### Subordinating conjunctions

[conjunctions](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/grammar/conjunctions)

Subordinating conjunctions join a subordinate clause to a main clause and establishes a relationship between the two. There are many subordinating clauses, but here are some of the most common:

    after, although, as much as/as soon as/as long as, as though, because, before, how, 
    if, in order to/in order that, once, since, than, that, though, unless, until, 
    when/whenever, where/wherever, whether, while


### That as a conjunction for noun clauses

[conjunctions](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/grammar/conjunctions)

> "For example,
>
>    Smith (2015) reported that more research was necessary.
>        Smith (2015) = subject
>        reported = verb
>        that more research was necessary = dependent clause, direct object of the verb "reported"
>    The authors hypothesized that there would be significant results.
>        The authors = subject
>        hypothesized = verb
>        that there would be significant results = dependent clause, direct object of the verb "hypothesized"
>    Jones (2014) asserted that confidentiality was maintained throughout the study.
>        Jones (2014) = subject
>        asserted = verb
>        that confidentiality was maintained throughout the study = dependent clause, direct object of the verb "asserted"
>    Rephrasing these sentences into questions and answers is one way to see that the "that" clauses are acting as direct objects.
>        What did Smith (2015) report?
>            Answer: that more research was necessary
>        What did the authors hypothesize?
>            Answer: that there would be significant results
>        What did Jones (2014) assert?
>            Answer: that confidentiality was maintained throughout the study
>
> In formal written English, for clarity, most academic writers choose to keep "that" 
> when it introduces a noun clause (Caplan, 2012). Leaving out "that" can cause the 
> reader to misread (at first anyway) the subject of the dependent clause as being the 
> object of the reporting verb (Jamieson, 2012).
>
> For example, if readers see the sentence, "Smith (2015) reported more research was 
> necessary (without 'that')," they may understand “more research” as the thing Smith 
> reported and then have to backtrack and reread upon seeing “was necessary.”
> Any structure that leads to misinterpretation, even temporarily, can be an unwanted 
> distraction from the writer’s message.
> In spoken English, however, "that" may be dropped in such sentences. (Intonation 
> patterns—rising and falling pitch—give the listener clues that may not be present in 
> writing.)"
