## Audio Setup

## Audio Issues
"dummy output" issue.
Seen on a [Debian Forum](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=104263) one of the answer to 
Pulse Audio shows "dummy output" linked to that KDE PulseAudio page:
[KDE PulseAudio Integration](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Desktops/KDE/)
"One thing that can happen is that some other process "hogs" the audio device during PulseAudio startup. When this happens PA is unable to use the device until it is restarted. If PA is unable to open your hardware, you will automatically be given a "Dummy Output". As the name suggests, anything that is "Played" via this device is inaudible). This "Dummy Output" should be easily visible in both KMix and Phonon. If this happens, then you can debug which process is hogging the hardware via the command: sudo lsof /dev/snd/* /dev/dsp* (Note that apps which have the /dev/snd/control* devices open are unlikely to interfere)."

Debian wiki [Missing playback devices or audio capture](https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio#Missing_playback_devices_or_audio_capture)
deleting the configuration files and restarting pulseaudio. 
The following commands restored audio:

    $ rm -r ~/.config/pulse /tmp/pulse-*
    $ pulseaudio --kill
    $ pulseaudio --start


# System information

Find out which Debian version is running

    cat /etc/issue

# Tools

These tools are not specific to Debian. I place them here because 
I use Debian as my main system. If a section gets too large it may get
moved to another page in the future. 


## Installing software

For software in the repository, use

    sudo apt install packagename

For software in .deb packages, check the md5sum and install with

    md5sum packagename
    sudo dpkg -i packagename

If there are missingdependencies and you fix them you can retry the previsouly failed installed with:
    sudo dpkg --configure -a

Remove a package with:

    sudo dpkg -r packagename

## Gimp

The most important Gimp shortcuts are: 

 * CTRL + B to open the tool Box
 * CTRL + L to open the Layers dialog

## Rstudio

Download Rstudio for Debian 

 * [Rstudio download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
 * [Rstudio preview download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

Run 

    dpkg -i rstudio-version-number.deb

# Upgrade Debian version

## From Jessie 8 to Stretch 9
I followed the documentation on 
[upgrades from Debian 8, Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html)

In bash store the output of apt-get install with many dependency issues in a text file

    $ sudo apt-get -f install > aptgetfinstall.txt

Using R to extract  all packages and try to remove them

    R> bli <- readLines("aptgetfinstall;txt")
    R> blil <- strsplit(grep("^ [[:alpha:]]", bli, value=TRUE),":")
    R> pkgissues <- unlist(lapply(blil, "[[", 1))

The bash command to remove a package was

    $ sudo dpkg --force-all -P <packagename>

Send this command for all packages

    R> lapply(paste("sudo dpkg --force-all -P ", pkgissues),system)
