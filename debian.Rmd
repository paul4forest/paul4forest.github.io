# Installing Debian 

The Debian GNU LInux operating system is available as a torent download at: 
[debian.org/CD/live/](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/).
Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide 
[instruction on how to copy the iso image to a usb key](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch04s03.html.en) 

Find the device name of my USB key (it had a previous Debian system on it):

    sudo fdisk -l
    # /dev/sdb1 

Unmount the USB key

    sudo umount /dev/sdb1

Transfer the iso image to the key

   sudo cp debian-live-9.5.0-amd64-gnome.iso /dev/sdb

The iso should be copied to `sdb` and not to `sdb1` !

Then the USB drive can be used to boot a laptop. 


## Debian on a HP Elitbook
Note: on a HP laptop make sure that the "legacy boot" is enabled 
and that the "secure boot" is disabled.
The boot devices can be choosen by pressing ESC at startup, then F9.

Debian installation went smoothly. 

After the installation, 
there was one issue with the wifi card having a non-free driver.
I had to place the package 
[firmware-iwlwifi](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/firmware-iwlwifi)
on a USB key. 
The download link is at the bottom of the page ([all](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/all/firmware-iwlwifi/download).
Then installed it from the usb key with 

    sudo apt install ./firmware-iwlwifi_20161130-3_all.deb

Alternatively, the .ucode file can also be found in 
[firmware-nonfree_20161130.orig.tar.xz](http://http.debian.net/debian/pool/non-free/f/firmware-nonfree/firmware-nonfree_20161130.orig.tar.xz)
And given directly during the installation step.

After that extra step, the wifi card was working inside Debian.

I updated the debian mirror to a nearby mirror in germany

    sudo apt edit-sources

"BootDevice Not Found" issue in a HP Elitebook:
[Grub-EFI reinstall](https://wiki.debian.org/GrubEFIReinstall)
The issue happenned on a partitionned disk. 
The fix was to completely erase the main disk and to reinstall a new debian on a single partition. 

# Audio

## Audio Setup

## Audio Issues
"dummy output" issue.
Seen on a [Debian Forum](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=104263) one of the answer to 
Pulse Audio shows "dummy output" linked to that KDE PulseAudio page:
[KDE PulseAudio Integration](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Desktops/KDE/)
"One thing that can happen is that some other process "hogs" the audio device during PulseAudio startup. When this happens PA is unable to use the device until it is restarted. If PA is unable to open your hardware, you will automatically be given a "Dummy Output". As the name suggests, anything that is "Played" via this device is inaudible). This "Dummy Output" should be easily visible in both KMix and Phonon. If this happens, then you can debug which process is hogging the hardware via the command: sudo lsof /dev/snd/* /dev/dsp* (Note that apps which have the /dev/snd/control* devices open are unlikely to interfere)."

Debian wiki [Missing playback devices or audio capture](https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio#Missing_playback_devices_or_audio_capture)
deleting the configuration files and restarting pulseaudio. 
The following commands restored audio:

    $ rm -r ~/.config/pulse /tmp/pulse-*
    $ pulseaudio --kill
    $ pulseaudio --start


# System information

Find out which Debian version is running

    cat /etc/issue


# Installing software

## APT

For software in the repository, use

    sudo apt install packagename


### APT behind a proxy

[Hash sum mismatch issue, fix bad proxy](https://askubuntu.com/a/809808/315347)

    sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99fixbadproxy

Enter: 

	Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth 0;
	Acquire::http::No-Cache true;
	Acquire::BrokenProxy    true;

Now run the update command:

    sudo apt update



## DEB packages

For software in .deb packages, check the md5sum and install with

    md5sum packagename
    sudo dpkg -i packagename

If there are missingdependencies and you fix them you can retry the previsouly failed installed with:
    sudo dpkg --configure -a

Remove a package with:

    sudo dpkg -r packagename


## Lyx

Default version of Lyx is 2.2 on debian strech.
wiki.lyx.org [LyXOnDebian](https://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/LyXOnDebian) 
explains how to install lyx 2.3 from the backports on Debian stretch. 

    sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
    # Add deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main 
    # Or a mirror, for example
    # deb http://ftp.it.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports install lyx


## R and Rstudio

### Installing R from the CRAN mirror

Install R from the CRAN repository,
see [Cran mirror of Debian packages](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/#debian-stretch-stable)

Add the following to /etc/apt/sources.list

    deb https://cran.stat.unipd.it/bin/linux/debian stretch-cran35/

In case you get an error:

    The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY FCAE2A0E115C3D8A

Add the PGP key so that this server is trusted :

    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key 'FCAE2A0E115C3D8A'

Based on this stackoverflow answer 
[about key server receive fail error](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/110594/85530)
I had to use a server providing a connection on port 80 because the default port is 
apparently blocked by a firewall on my network.

Then run the following to upgrade R to the lastest version availale on your CRAN mirror:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade 

### Installing Rstudio

Download Rstudio for Debian 

 * [Rstudio download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
 * [Rstudio preview download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

Run 

    dpkg -i rstudio-version-number.deb

Dependency error: rstudio depends on libclang-dev
Install it 

    sudo apt install libclang-dev

[Uninstall rstudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200554736-How-To-Uninstall-RStudio-Desktop)

    sudo apt remove rstudio

## Remmina

Installing from the backports (see above section on how to add the backports in sources.list)

    sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports install remmina 


# Tools

These tools are not specific to Debian. I place them here because 
I use Debian as my main system. If a section gets too large it may get
moved to another page in the future. 

## Gimp

The most important Gimp shortcuts are: 

 * CTRL + B to open the tool Box
 * CTRL + L to open the Layers dialog

A [list of Gimp Shortcuts](http://gimptips.com/articles/gimp-keyboard-shortcuts)

# Upgrade Debian version

## From Jessie 8 to Stretch 9
I followed the documentation on 
[upgrades from Debian 8, Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html)

In bash store the output of apt-get install with many dependency issues in a text file

    $ sudo apt-get -f install > aptgetfinstall.txt

Using R to extract  all packages and try to remove them

    R> bli <- readLines("aptgetfinstall;txt")
    R> blil <- strsplit(grep("^ [[:alpha:]]", bli, value=TRUE),":")
    R> pkgissues <- unlist(lapply(blil, "[[", 1))

The bash command to remove a package was

    $ sudo dpkg --force-all -P <packagename>

Send this command for all packages

    R> lapply(paste("sudo dpkg --force-all -P ", pkgissues),system)
