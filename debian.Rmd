## Audio Issues
"dummy output" issue.
Seen on a [Debian Forum](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=104263) one of the answer to 
Pulse Audio shows "dummy output" linked to that KDE PulseAudio page:
[KDE PulseAudio Integration](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Desktops/KDE/)
"One thing that can happen is that some other process "hogs" the audio device during PulseAudio startup. When this happens PA is unable to use the device until it is restarted. If PA is unable to open your hardware, you will automatically be given a "Dummy Output". As the name suggests, anything that is "Played" via this device is inaudible). This "Dummy Output" should be easily visible in both KMix and Phonon. If this happens, then you can debug which process is hogging the hardware via the command: sudo lsof /dev/snd/* /dev/dsp* (Note that apps which have the /dev/snd/control* devices open are unlikely to interfere).

If you need to restart PulseAudio, generally a reboot is simplest. Alternatively, issue the commands: pulseaudio -k; start-pulseaudio-x11; start-pulseaudio-kde. The first command will kill the running daemon, then the second two start PulseAudio and load some additional modules that are normally loaded as part of your typical login procedure. Please note that some applications may require to be restarted after restarting PulseAudio. "

# Upgrade 

## From Jessie 8 to Stretch 9
I followed the documentation on 
[upgrades from Debian 8, Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html)

In bash store the output of apt-get install with many dependency issues in a text file

    $ sudo apt-get -f install > aptgetfinstall.txt

Using R to extract  all packages and try to remove them

    R> bli <- readLines("aptgetfinstall;txt")
    R> blil <- strsplit(grep("^ [[:alpha:]]", bli, value=TRUE),":")
    R> pkgissues <- unlist(lapply(blil, "[[", 1))

The bash command to remove a package was

    $ sudo dpkg --force-all -P <packagename>

Send this command for all packages

    R> lapply(paste("sudo dpkg --force-all -P ", pkgissues),system)
