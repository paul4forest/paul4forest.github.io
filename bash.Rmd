# Introduction
This page is the continuation of [my blog post on GNU-Linux bash shell commands](https://paulremote.blogspot.de/2014/01/linux-shell-commands.html).


Linux is the kernel of the operating system on top of which other programs are built. A detailed list of GNU core utilities is available under the command :

    info coreutils 

The page below also contains many commands from external tools 
that are not part of the GNU project.

# Files 


## Get information about a file
Determine file type and encoding. The -i option shows the mime type strings.

    file filename
    file -i filename

list a directory
```{bash}
ls
ls -R # list subdirectories recursively
ls -lh # sizes in human readable format
```

Display the [last modification date of a file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16391208/print-a-files-last-modified-date-in-bash)

    date -r <filename>
    ls -l <filename>
    
More file information

    stat <filename>
    
## Find files
Find files in subdirectories of the current directory (Quotes are requited to prevent shell command expansion).

    find . -name "*.pdf" 

    find . -mtime 0 # modified in the last 24 hours

Find files in the whole system

    locate filename

## File and folder compression
Decompress a file

     gunzip file.gz

How do I compress a whole directory?

    tar -zcvf archive-name.tar.gz directory-name 

Where

    -z: Compress archive using gzip program
    -c: Create archive
    -v: Verbose i.e display progress while creating archive
    -f: Archive File name

To extract content from the archive in the current directory

    tar -zxvf archive-name.tar.gz 

## Rename files
For example to rename all upper-case .JPG extension into lower-case .jpg extension.

    rename 's/\.JPG$/\.jpg/' *.JPG

# Search, filter and count lines in text files
Count the number of lines in a file

    wc -l filename.txt 

Count occurrences of a word in a file

    grep -roh word filename.txt  | wc -w

Remove duplicated lines from a file

    awk '!a[$0]++' input.txt 

Search with Grep

     grep "text" file.txt

[Awk tutorial](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html#uh-11), for example  filter a large file for lines that have a third field (product code) starting with 44, keep the header line:

    awk -F, '$3 ~ /^44/||NR==1' nc201501.dat|less

Regexp match begining of and end of line with ^ and \$.

Follow the end of a log file as it is written 

    tail -f

See tab and end of line characters in a text file

    cat -te filename |less 

## Replace strings in text files
Replace strings

    first="I love Suzy and Mary"
    second="Sara"
    first=${first/Suzy/$second}

Replace strings with sed

    sed -i  's/pattern/replacement/g' bli.txt 

    sed -i  's/^.*\://g' input_file.txt # edit file in place
    grep EMAIL input_file.txt |sed  's/^.*\://g' > output_file.txt 

Replace strings with perl in a git repository

    git grep -lz 'readcsvfromgauss'| xargs -0 perl -i'' -pE "s/readcsvfromgauss/readcsvfromgauss0/g"

# PDF files
Commands based on the poppler library for PDF manipulation.
Search a text pattern in all PDF files present in a directory:

    pdfgrep pattern *.pdf

 Merge multiple PDF into one:

    pdfunite in-1.pdf in-2.pdf in-n.pdf out.pdf

Alternatively, pdftk can be used to merge PDF files

    pdftk input1.pdf input2.pdf cat output output.pdf

# Videos and audio
Install youtube-dl using pip:

     sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl

Download a video from youtube :

    youtube-dl video_url

Download only the audio in an .mp3 format

    youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 video_url

# Users

## Manager users and groups
Check your user id

    id 

What group do you belong to as a user

    groups

Add a new user

    useradd username

Set a password for the new user

    passwd username 

Delete a user

    userdel username

Temporary log in as a given user

    su username

Add a user to the super users

    adduser username sudo

That user needs to re-log into the shell for the change to take effect.

Show all users

    getent passwd

Show all groups

    getent group 

# Change file permission


Change user and group of a file

    chown groupname:username filename

Change file permission

    chmod a=rwx filename
    chmod 777 filename 

Change file permissions recursively:

    chmod 755 directoryname

Chmod instructions can be given with characters or numbers, chmod 777 or chmod a=rwx is a question of preference.

    Some prefer 755 over 777 because giving write access to group and other users could be a security risk. 755 leaves read and execute rights to groups and other users. 755 is visible as "rwxr-xr-x" in ls -l. 
    The default for document files on Debian seems to be chmod 644, visible as "-rw-r--r--" in ls -l.



# System
OS release

    less /etc/os-release 

Disk usage

    du -hd1  # sub-folder size at depth=1 
    du -hs * # sub-folder size summary

Display available space on drives

    df -h

Display available RAM memory

    less /proc/meminfo


Install a program

    sudo apt-get install 

 System name

    uname -a

    file /sbin/init

    hostname -f 

Start and quit a super user session

    su
    exit 

Last time the system was started

    last reboot 
    last

Show environment variables

    printenv 
    printenv LC_TIME

# Monitoring

Run a command every 2 seconds, 
for example to list a folder as new files are beeing written to it:

    watch ls

Follow the end of a log file, as it is written

    tail filename.log


# Job handling
List

    jobs

Bring a job to the foreground

    fg job_number

Run a job in the background. A command followed by an & will run in the background.

Stop a job

    CTRL ^ Z

Quit a job

     CTRL ^ C

Kill a malfunctionning program:

    kill process_id
    kill -9 process_it # -9 forces the kill

Find a program id with:

    ps aux

Kill a graphical program, by clicking on it:

     xkill


# Secure shell
log into a remote machine

    ssh user@remote_machine

Copy a local file to a file on the remote machine

    scp local_file_name user@remote_machine:path_to_file/file_name

Copy a file from the remote machine to a local file

    scp user@remote_machine:path_to_file/file_name  local_file_name

Copy a full directory (dmouraty) from the remote machine:

     scp -rp user@dest:/path destdirectory

# Alias

    alias ll="ls -lh" 


Based on how can i sort du-h output by size

    alias du='du -hd1 | sort -h -r'


You can place those commands in your ~/.bashrc to create a permanent alias.
bashrc:

>    "You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly."

# .bash_profile and .bashrc
These are places where a user can turn of the system BEEP :

    setterm -blength 0

.bash_profile is executed on login shell, when you login in another tty or when you access a system through ssh. .bashrc is executed on non-login shells when you open a terminal window in Gnome.

Debian Dotfiles

    "Now, since bash is being invoked as a login shell (with name "-bash", a special ancient hack), it reads /etc/profile first. Then it looks in your home directory for .bash_profile, and if it finds it, it reads that."

    [...] "You may have noted that .bashrc is not being read in this situation. You should therefore always have command source ~/.bashrc at the end of your .bash_profile in order to force it to be read by a login shell.  "

In .bashrc a user can set environment variables, define alias (see above).

# Keyboard
bash french blogger recommended a simple shell command to change keyboard layout :

    sudo loadkeys fr

fr-keyboard on Debian wiki for a more permanent system configuration and use in GUI apps. Switching between keyboads can then be done with:

    setxkbmap de
    setxkbmap fr

Information about the system
Debian-Admin Finding out basic information about your Hardware:

    cat /proc/meminfo
    cat /proc/cpuinfo

Find your Debian version

    cat /etc/debian_version
    lsb_release -a
