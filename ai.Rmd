## Recommender systems and the electorate
Today February 10 2020, I heard about the victory of Shin Fein in the Irish elections. 
I'm wondering again about the influence of social media algorithms from You tube and Facebook on the electorate.
It struck me many times that when I listen to Irish folk music on Youtube, the recommender system always suggests me 
military related them songs in the playlist. Is it because most viewers want to hear military songs? 
I have to search explicitly for peace related songs. 

Recommender systems maximise the stimulation of the limbic system. I guess there is more stimulation through 
war themed songs than through peace songs?
