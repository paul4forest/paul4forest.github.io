A bit of science fiction to lighten you up. The pressure on the environment
will be relieved once humanity and especially manufacturing has moved to space.
The computing industry is rising as the most energy hungry on earth. IT can
move to space first (large solar arrays). Once we have built a Dyson swarm of
solar powered space computers, then we can set new goals of total earth
protection.
