# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to analyse communication 
options such as mail, social media, chat, calls and video calls from
the perspective of a privacy conscious individual.


# Mail

## Email

Email is an open protocol and that is good because it means 
you can exchange emails with someone who uses an email server from a different company.

Through communication tools such as skype or Whatsapp, you can only communicate
with people registered at the same company.


## Snail mail

Snail mail can be seen as an emotional form of communication through a physical
medium: paper. You can smell it. You can touch it. You can drop a tear on it.
You can tear it apart. You can burn it. It's based on plants that were growing
in a forest somewhere. It might have been recycled. It might have spend time in
a trash bin. 


# Chat, calls and video calls
## Riot

Riot-web is a chat application based on the matrix decentralised communication protocol. 

## Signal 

The issue is that the desktop client requires a mobile phone with camera to be started. 
As of January 2020 I still use a nokia 3010 phone.
I cannot install the signal application on that phone and this means that I cannot use signal on my desktop. 

## Skype

Skype was purchased by Microsoft. 
Screen sharing has a poor quality on Linux desktop.


## Telegram

Another chat application. 

## Whatsapp

[Why you should switch to signal or telegram](https://medium.com/@contactsunny/why-you-should-switch-to-signal-or-telegram-from-whatsapp-today-fa773694d05e) (2018):

Whatsapp betrayed its user by sharing contact details with FaceBook for advertisement purposes:

> phone to tailor ads to you. They will see your contacts list (which they
> already are, actually). This is a clear betrayal, for many users. "

## Webex

## Zoom 

Call with screen sharing in great quality.

# Social Media

Social media "facilitate controlled experimentation".
When you use social media, you subject yourself to experimentation and behaviour modification.
