# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to analyse communication options such as mail,
social media, chat, calls and video calls from the perspective of a privacy
conscious individual. I also care about freedom of speech and would like to
avoid vendor lock in.


## Network effects

Network effects appear when friends encourage you to choose a particular
platform. It is hard to resist the pressure from peers, friends and family who
describe how convenient the software is and how nice it would be to write,
talk, share pictures and videos on that platform. Network effects are natural, I
suppose. They can apply to any form of communication. 

# Silos versus freedom

Through communication tools such as Skype, Whatsapp or Zoom you can only
communicate with people registered at the same company.  
Incompatible tools split our digital expression into silos. These silos lock us
to a particular platform and limit our freedom of expression. Once a silo has
managed to attract a large number of users, network effects pushes those users
to attract more peers inside. 

Our communication doesn't have to be locked into a particular platform. The
internet protocols were conceived with neutrality at the core.

# Mail

## Email

Email is an open protocol and that is good because it means you can exchange
emails with someone who uses an email server from a different company. In other
words there are no communication silos with email.

Most [emails are encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_encryption) at
the transport layer. End-to-end encryption would be better, but it's usage is
rare. 


## Snail mail

Snail mail can be seen as an emotional form of communication through a physical
medium: paper. You can smell it. You can touch it. You can drop a tear on it.
You can tear it apart. You can burn it. It's based on plants that were growing
in a forest somewhere. It might have spent time in a trash bin. It might have
been recycled.


# Chat, calls and video calls

What happened to the [VOIP software on
Linux](https://www.linuxlinks.com/VoIP/)?
Why is there such a reliance on proprietary platforms?
Is it because of technical constraints or are there other political reasons for
it?

Free programs recommended by Richard Stallmann on his [skype
page](https://stallman.org/skype.html): [Jami](https://jami.net/),
[Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/),
[Mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page), [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/).


## Ekiga

[Ekiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekiga) is/was a softphone for gnome Linux
desktop. Development has stopped since the last release in What happened to it?
Why has development stopped? According to wikipedia, the original developer
[Damien Sandras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Sandras) is now working
for be.ip on open source voip software. 

## Linphone

[Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/technical-corner/linphone?qt-technical_corner=2#qt-technical_corner)
Development and support available from Belledonne-communications, a company
based in Bordeaux, France. 

[Linphone desktop](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-desktop) is
programmed mostly in C++ the
[sdk](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-sdk) has some java code in
it. 

## Element

[Element](https://element.io/get-started), previously called Riot-web is a chat
application based on the matrix decentralised communication protocol. Matrix is
an open protocol meant to avoid communication silos.


## Signal 

The issue is that the desktop client requires a mobile phone with camera to be
started. As of January 2020 I still use a nokia 3010 phone. I cannot install
the signal application on that phone and this means that I cannot use signal on
my desktop.

## Skype

Skype was purchased by Microsoft. 
Screen sharing has a poor quality on Linux desktop.

## Teams

A Microsoft product.

I use second-hand laptop computers with open source software on them. They cost
less than a fifth of new computers and I run them for years. This is not
possible with Microsoft windows, because they have this different world-view/
incentives to build planed obsolescence into their products.

## Telegram

Another chat application. 

## Whatsapp

Short message to friends: 

I don't use Whatsapp for ethical reasons, because of the Cambridge Analytica
scandal and the risk posed by Facebook's extensive use of personal data and
social connections to sell not only advertisement but also political influence.
Whatsapp users give away the frequency and location of their interpersonal
connections. This data describes every users preferences within its social
graph. As Whatsapps user base grows, it makes the social graph available for a
better fit of the machine learning models that influence our decision making.
These rather simple models feed us with information and optimise the effect
that this information has on shifting the needle of a purchasing decision or a
voting decision. Facebook has billions of users. Among them there are several
hundred users similar to us. The information that was the most effective at
influencing their decision will be shown to us first. The models are driven to
optimize viewing time and engagement, as a result, controversial or shocking
news will be shown more often. The use of these models becomes unethical when
misleading or false information is propagated within the network. Facebook
provides the infrastructure and sells the users metadata necessary for these
advertisement models to operate within our societies. It has been accused by
multiple jurisdictions in the US and in Europe of not putting sufficient
safeguards in place to avoid the oversized influence of misleading actors.
Already in many developing countries, Facebook is gaining more revenue from
political campaign funds than from advertisement.

[Why you should switch to signal or telegram](https://medium.com/@contactsunny/why-you-should-switch-to-signal-or-telegram-from-whatsapp-today-fa773694d05e) (2018):

Whatsapp betrayed its user by sharing contact details with FaceBook for advertisement purposes:

## Webex

A question I wrote:

## Zoom 

Call with screen sharing in great quality.

# Social Media

Social media "facilitate controlled experimentation". When you use social
media, you subject yourself to experimentation and behaviour modification.
