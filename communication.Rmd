# Introduction
The purpose of this document is to analyse communication 
options such as mail, chat, calls and video calls from
the perspective of a privacy conscious individual.


# Snail mail

Snail mail can be seen as an emotional form of communication through a physical medium.

# Email

Email is an open protocol and that is good because it means 
you can exchange emails with someone who uses an email server from a different company.

Through communication tools such as skype or Whatsapp, you can only communicate
with people registered at the same company.


# Riot

Riot-web is a chat application based on the matrix decentralised communication protocol. 

# Signal 

The issue is that the desktop client requires a mobile phone with camera to be started. 
As of January 2020 I still use a nokia 3010 phone and this means I cannot use signal on my desktop. 

# Skype

Skype was purchased by Microsoft. 
Screen sharing has a poor quality on Linux desktop.

# Telegram

Another chat application. 

# Whatsapp

[Why you should switch to signal or telegram](https://medium.com/@contactsunny/why-you-should-switch-to-signal-or-telegram-from-whatsapp-today-fa773694d05e) (2018):

Whatsapp betrayed its user by sharing contact details with FaceBook for advertisement purposes:

> "Today, we know that there’s a separate WhatsApp app for businesses. And now

> already are, actually). This is a clear betrayal, for many users. "


# Zoom 

Call with screen sharing in great quality.
