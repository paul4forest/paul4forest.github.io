# Docker Installation

To get the most recent stable docker version 
on a Debian, system, add the docker repository as explained in 
[Docker community edition for Debian.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
Then run :

    sudo apt-get install docker-ce
 
# Build

Instructions to create a container are storred in a Dockerfile.
Docker hub is a collection of Dockerfiles. 
Containers stored on docker hub can be pulled and started directly from the docker run command.
The section below explain how to write your own Docker file.

## Docker file

docs.docker.com [best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/)

Build a container based on the Dockerfile in the present working directory

    docker build -t friendlyhello .

Dockerfile from R packages:

* [bcm-uga/TESS3_encho_sen/Dockerfile](https://github.com/bcm-uga/TESS3_encho_sen/blob/master/Dockerfile) FROM rocker/hadleyverse


I used R CMD build inside the docker file to build a package.

    # Set the working directory to /R
    WORKDIR /R

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /R/packagename
    ADD . /R/packagename

    RUN R CMD build packagename

    # R CMD build generates the file name from the description file
    # Remember to update file name here below after a version update
    RUN R -e 'install.packages("packagename_0.1.0.tar.gz")'


## Compose file

docs.docker.com [how services work](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/)

Compose several containers in a service


# Start

## Start containers

Start a container

    sudo docker run hello-world

Restart a container 

    sudo docker restart hello-world

Stop a container 

    sudo docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]

### Docker run options

* `-i, --interactive` Keep STDIN open even if not attached
* `rm`=true|false “Automatically remove the container when it exits (incompatible with  -d).  The default is false.”
* `-t, --tty` Allocate a pseudo-TTY
* `-v`, --volume=[] Bind mount a volume (e.g., from the host: -v /host:/container, from Docker: -v /container) The -v option can be used one or more times to add one or more mounts to  a  container.  These  mounts  can  then  be  used  in other containers using the --volumes-from option.


## Start services

swarm init error:

I specified the IP address 
Stackoverflow [could not choose and IP address Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38602903/docker-swarm-init-could-not-choose-an-ip-address-error)


# Monitor

## Monitor running containers

[run metrics](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/runmetrics/)

    docker stats <container-id>

Start a bash shell inside a container 

    docker ps # find the ID of the running container
    docker exec -it <container-id> bash 

[Find the IP of a container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17157721/how-to-get-a-docker-containers-ip-address-from-the-host):

    sudo docker ps # look for the process id
    sudo docker inspect <container id>

The IP is at the end.

### Inspect options

Inspect the [run restart policies](https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies-restart)
Get the number of times a container was restarted:

    docker inspect -f "{{ .RestartCount }}" my-container

Get the last time the container was (re)started;

    docker inspect -f "{{ .State.StartedAt }}" my-container


## Monitor stopped containers 
See [stopped containers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30231187/docker-list-only-stopped-containers/30231188#30231188)

    docker ps --filter "status=exited"

Inspect a stopped container

    docker inspect <container-id>


## Manage container images

Show available images on the system:

    sudo docker images

## Monitor running services
see which services are running

    docker service ls

see which services are running inside a service

    docker service ps <service_name> 

You can also run `docker ps` to see all running processes.

# Cleanup

A container should be stopped before it can be removed.
Stop a container

    docker ps
    docker stop <container-id>

Remove a stopped container

    docker rm <container-id>

Remove all stopped containers

    docker container prune

Remove images

    docker images # list available images
    docker image rm  <image-id>
