# Docker Installation

To get the most recent stable docker version 
on a Debian, system, add the docker repository as explained in 
[Docker community edition for Debian.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
Then run :

    sudo apt-get install docker-ce
 
# Build

Instructions to create a container are storred in a Dockerfile.
Docker hub is a collection of Dockerfiles. 
Containers stored on docker hub can be pulled and started directly from the docker run command.
The section below explain how to write your own Docker file.

## Docker file

docs.docker.com [best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/)

Build a container based on the Dockerfile in the present working directory

    docker build -t friendlyhello .

Dockerfile from R packages:

* [bcm-uga/TESS3_encho_sen/Dockerfile](https://github.com/bcm-uga/TESS3_encho_sen/blob/master/Dockerfile) FROM rocker/hadleyverse


I used R CMD build inside the docker file to build a package.

    # Set the working directory to /R
    WORKDIR /R

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /R/packagename
    ADD . /R/packagename

    RUN R CMD build packagename

    # R CMD build generates the file name from the description file
    # Remember to update file name here below after a version update
    RUN R -e 'install.packages("packagename_0.1.0.tar.gz")'


## Compose file

docs.docker.com [how services work](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/)

Compose several containers in a service
[Networking in compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/) from version 2, 
[links are not required](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#links), for example with

  db:
    image: postgres
      ports:
         - "8001:5432"

> “Within the web container [in the same compose file], your connection string to db would look like postgres://db:5432, and from the host machine, the connection string would look like postgres://{DOCKER_IP}:8001.” 

[Restart policy]()

    deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure


# Start

## Start containers

Start a container

    sudo docker run hello-world

Restart a container 

    sudo docker restart hello-world

Stop a container 

    sudo docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]

### Docker run options

* `-i, --interactive` Keep STDIN open even if not attached
* `rm`=true|false “Automatically remove the container when it exits (incompatible with  -d).  The default is false.”
* `-t, --tty` Allocate a pseudo-TTY
* `-v`, --volume=[] Bind mount a volume (e.g., from the host: -v /host:/container, from Docker: -v /container) The -v option can be used one or more times to add one or more mounts to  a  container.  These  mounts  can  then  be  used  in other containers using the --volumes-from option.


## Start services

Create a compose file
then start the service with:

    docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml servicename 

Stop the service with:

    docker stack rm servicename 

swarm init error:

I specified the IP address 
Stackoverflow [could not choose and IP address Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38602903/docker-swarm-init-could-not-choose-an-ip-address-error)


# Monitor

## Monitor running containers

[run metrics](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/runmetrics/)

    docker stats <container-id>

Start a bash shell inside a container 

    docker ps # find the ID of the running container
    docker exec -it <container-id> bash 

[Find the IP of a container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17157721/how-to-get-a-docker-containers-ip-address-from-the-host):

    sudo docker ps # look for the process id
    sudo docker inspect <container id>

The IP is at the end. it can also be [extracted with a template](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20686101/2641825):

     sudo docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}} IP {{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <container id> 


### Inspect options

Inspect the [run restart policies](https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies-restart)
Get the number of times a container was restarted:

    docker inspect -f "{{ .RestartCount }}" my-container

Get the last time the container was (re)started;

    docker inspect -f "{{ .State.StartedAt }}" my-container

### Container logs

    docker logs [OPTIONS] <container id>

## Monitor stopped containers 
See [stopped containers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30231187/docker-list-only-stopped-containers/30231188#30231188)

    docker ps --filter "status=exited"

Inspect a stopped container

    docker inspect <container-id>


## Manage container images

Show available images on the system:

    sudo docker images

## Monitor running services
see which stacks are running

    sudo docker stack ls
    sudo docker stack services <stackname>

see which services are running

    docker service ls

see which containers are running inside a service

    docker service ps <service_name> 

You can also run `docker ps` to see all running processes.

# Cleanup

A container should be stopped before it can be removed.
Stop a container

    docker ps
    docker stop <container-id>

Remove a stopped container

    docker rm <container-id>

Remove all stopped containers

    docker container prune

Remove images

    docker images # list available images
    docker image rm  <image-id>


# Security
docs.docker.com [Manage sensitive data with Docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)
 * [Example use secrets with a Wordpress service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/#advanced-example-use-secrets-with-a-wordpress-service)
 * [Use secrets in compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/#use-secrets-in-compose)
   * Declare the location of secrets :

     secrets:
       db_password:
         file: db_password.txt
       db_root_password:
         file: db_root_password.txt

   * give access to secrets to a service :

       db:
         image: mysql:latest
         volumes:
           - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
         environment:
           MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_root_password
           MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
           MYSQL_USER: wordpress
           MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
         secrets:
           - db_root_password
           - db_password
     


Stackoverflow [Docker and securing passwords](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22651647/docker-and-securing-passwords)
previous solution recommended passing passwords as environement variables.
Docker now has a native solution to deal with secrets.
